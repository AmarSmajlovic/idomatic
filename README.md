idomatic
idomatic is a CLI tool that automatically adds id attributes to your HTML/JSX/TSX components. It helps improve your testing and QA processes by ensuring that key elements always have unique, predictable identifiers.

Note: idomatic is optimized for React and HTML-based projects (including Vue and Angular). You can choose your framework during setup, and the tool will create a default configuration accordingly.

Features
Automatic ID Injection: Scans your project files and injects id attributes into components that are missing them.

Configurable Behavior: Customize the prefix, specify file extensions, exclude certain tags, and more.

Dry Run and Write Modes: Preview changes before actually updating your files.

Framework Specific Defaults: Pre-populated configurations for React (JS/TSX) or HTML-based projects (HTML/Vue/Angular).

Easy Integration: Use with your existing build or CI/CD processes.

Installation
You can install idomatic using your favorite package manager. For example:

bash
Copy

# Using npm

```shell
npm install --save-dev @idomatic/core`
```

# Using yarn

```shell
yarn add --dev @idomatic/core
```

# Using bun

```shell
bun add --dev @idomatic/core
```

Additionally, if you haven't set up the configuration for idomatic, you can run the initializer:

```shell
npx idomatic --init
```

This command will guide you through selecting your framework and create a default configuration file (.idomatic.config.json) in your project's root.

Usage
CLI Commands
After installation and configuration, you can run idomatic using the following commands:

Dry Run: Preview the changes without modifying any files.

```shell
npx idomatic scan --dry
```

Write Mode: Apply the changes to your files.

```shell
npx idomatic scan --write
```

If you run npx idomatic scan without any flags, a usage message will be shown.

Configuration File
The configuration file .idomatic.config.json is created during the setup process. Here is an example configuration for a React project:

```js
{
"attributeName": "id",
"prefix": "auto-id-",
"excludeTags": ["html", "head", "script"],
"includeExtensions": ["js", "jsx", "ts", "tsx"],
"excludeFiles": []
}
```

You can customize these values to better suit your projectâ€™s needs. For HTML/Vue/Angular projects, the includeExtensions field will be set to ["html", "vue", "ng.html"].

How It Works
Setup:
Run the setup command (npx idomatic --init) to choose your framework and create a configuration file.

Scanning:
The tool uses your configuration to search for files matching the specified extensions.

Dry Run: Lists the files that would be processed without modifying them.

Write Mode: Processes each file, adding id attributes where needed.

Parsing:
Depending on the file type, idomatic imports the appropriate parser (@idomatic/parser-js for JavaScript/JSX/TSX or @idomatic/parser-html for HTML-based files) to modify your code using an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).

Example
Imagine you have a React component without an id attribute:

```js
function Button() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}
```

After running idomatic in write mode, the component might be transformed to:

```js
function Button() {
  return (
    <button id="auto-id-123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000">Click me</button>
  );
}
```

The generated id includes a prefix (from the configuration) and a unique identifier.
