# Idomatic

**Idomatic** is a CLI tool that automatically adds id attributes to your HTML/JSX/TSX components. It helps improve your testing and QA processes by ensuring that key elements always have unique, predictable identifiers.

_Note: Idomatic is optimized for React and HTML-based projects (including Vue and Angular). During setup, you choose your framework, and the tool creates a default configuration accordingly._

## Features

- **Automatic ID Injection:** Scans your project files and injects id attributes into components that are missing them.
- **Configurable Behavior:** Customize the prefix, specify file extensions, exclude certain tags, and more.
- **Dry Run and Write Modes:** Preview changes before actually updating your files.
- **Framework Specific Defaults:** Pre-populated configurations for React (JS/TSX) or HTML-based projects (HTML/Vue/Angular).
- **Easy Integration:** Seamlessly integrate with your existing build or CI/CD processes.

## Installation

To install Idomatic, run the initializer command:

```shell
npm init @idomatic
```
